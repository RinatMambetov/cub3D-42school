# cub3D-42school (my grade is 115/100)
My first RayCaster with miniLibX.<br><br>
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.<br><br>
This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.<br><br>
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.<br><br>
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.<br><br>
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.<br><br>
